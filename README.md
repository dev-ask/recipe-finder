# Recipe Finder
A web app powered by Spoonacular API.

# About version 2.0
- User can enter ingredient name to find recipes around it.
- Version 2 can now render more than one recipe results.
- Each recipe result now has an embedded link to its source.
- Old recipe search results are cleared before new ones are rendered.
- Improved CSS for search results. 

# Important
- This web app currently runs on a FREE Spoonacular account. 
- Current limit for search results is set to two, due to limited number of API requests that can be made on a daily basis. 
- This limit can be tweaked inside code to render a maximum of 10 results, as supported by Spoonacular API, but will of course consume more of the request quota.
- Each recipe result consumes 2 out of 150 API requests available for the day.
